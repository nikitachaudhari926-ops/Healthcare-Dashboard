🏥 GoodHealth Private Hospital – Power BI Analytics Dashboard

📌 Objective :- 

• The objective of this project is to design an end-to-end hospital analytics solution using Power BI that provides actionable insights into patient flow, hospital operations, bed utilization, revenue, length of stay (LOS), and patient experience. The dashboard helps hospital management make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency, care quality, and resource planning.

📊 Project Overview :- 

This Power BI project consists of interactive dashboards built for a private hospital scenario, covering:
•	Hospital-level performance metrics
•	Patient admission and discharge trends
•	Department-wise operational efficiency
•	Bed occupancy and ICU monitoring
•	Revenue and demographic analysis
•	Patient satisfaction and feedback insights
The solution uses custom DAX measures, data modeling, and advanced visual storytelling to convert raw healthcare data into meaningful insights.

📈 Key Insights Generated :- 

•	High bed occupancy highlights peak operational load and capacity utilization
•	ER wait times vary significantly by department, identifying bottlenecks
•	Older age groups show higher LOS, indicating higher resource consumption
•	Major revenue contribution comes from 21–60 age groups
•	OPD and Surgery departments handle the highest patient volume
•	Majority of patients stay 1–2 days, useful for bed turnover planning
•	Patient feedback indicates strong satisfaction, but improvement areas exist

🧠 How This Dashboard Helps :-
