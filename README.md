🏥 GoodHealth Private Hospital – Power BI Analytics Dashboard

📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to design an end-to-end hospital analytics solution using Power BI that provides actionable insights into patient flow, hospital operations, bed utilization, revenue, length of stay (LOS), and patient experience.
The dashboard helps hospital management make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency, care quality, and resource planning.

📊 Project Overview
This Power BI project consists of interactive dashboards built for a private hospital scenario, covering:
•	Hospital-level performance metrics
•	Patient admission and discharge trends
•	Department-wise operational efficiency
•	Bed occupancy and ICU monitoring
•	Revenue and demographic analysis
•	Patient satisfaction and feedback insights
The solution uses custom DAX measures, data modeling, and advanced visual storytelling to convert raw healthcare data into meaningful insights.

📁 Dashboards Included
1️⃣ Hospital Summary Dashboard
Provides a high-level snapshot of hospital performance.
Key KPIs:
•	Total Patients
•	Inpatients & Outpatients
•	Total Staff
•	Average Treatment Cost
•	Average ER Time
•	Patient-to-Staff Ratio
•	Occupied Beds
Key Visuals:
•	In & Out Patients by Week
•	Bed Occupancy Gauge
•	Revenue by Age Group
•	ER Time by Department
•	Patient Feedback Analysis
•	Rating by Age Group

2️⃣ Patients Summary Dashboard
Focuses on patient demographics and hospitalization patterns.
Key KPIs:
•	Total Patients
•	Admitted & Discharged Patients
•	Average Length of Stay (LOS)
•	ICU & Death Count
•	Occupied Beds
•	Total Revenue
Key Visuals:
•	Patient Distribution by Gender
•	Patients by Age Group
•	Average LOS by Age Group
•	Department-wise Inpatients by Status
•	Bed Count by Department
•	Patient Breakdown by LOS Duration


📈 Key Insights Generated
•	High bed occupancy highlights peak operational load and capacity utilization
•	ER wait times vary significantly by department, identifying bottlenecks
•	Older age groups show higher LOS, indicating higher resource consumption
•	Major revenue contribution comes from 21–60 age groups
•	OPD and Surgery departments handle the highest patient volume
•	Majority of patients stay 1–2 days, useful for bed turnover planning
•	Patient feedback indicates strong satisfaction, but improvement areas exist
